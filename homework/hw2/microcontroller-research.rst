Micro Controller Research
#########################

1)From the picture, Atmel manufactures the chip.

2)8 pins are available for connecting to external devices to be controlled.

3)Minimum of adding a light and powersupply.

4)The attiny has 8KB of program memory.

5)The attiny has 512 RAM bytes of program data.

6)The CPU speed of attiny is 20 MIPS at 20 MHz.

7)Using a network of multiple chips can solve many problems. to create a network of multiple chips we must be able to connect them together and they must be powered by a common power supply.

Basic Measurements units:
#########################

1 meter = <39.3701> inches (https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/length/meter-to-inch.html)

1 mile = <5280> feet (https://www.wyzant.com/resources/lessons/math/elementary_math/measurement)

1 mile = <1609.34> meters (http://www.metric-conversions.org/length/miles-to-meters.htm)

Circ. of Earth = <3,963> miles (https://www.space.com/17638-how-big-is-earth.html)


Basic terminology
############

yotta something = <10^23> times something (http://bbruner.org/metric.htm)

kilo something = <10^3> times something

<hecto> something = 100 times something

<deka> something = 10 times something

something = something(duh!)

milli something = <1/10^3> of something

micro something = <1/10^6> of something

nano something = <1/10^9> of something

<pico> something = 1/1000000000000 of something

What is the speed of light?

	o =<186,000>mps (https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/Numbers/Math/Mathematical_Thinking/how_fast_is_the_speed.htm)

	o = <299792.458>kps (https://www.unitjuggler.com/convert-speed-from-c-to-kms.html)

Speed of Electronic Signals
###########################

How far an electronic signal can move through a wire:

	In one nanosecond = <11.8> (https://www.chemteam.info/Electrons/LightSpeedTrivia.html)

	In one microsecond = <983.6> feet (https://www.convert-me.com/en/convert/length/lightmicrosecond.html?u=lightmicrosecond&v=1)

	In one millisecond = <186.2824> miles (http://www.kylesconverter.com/speed-or-velocity/light-speed-to-miles-per-millisecond)

	In one second = <186,282> miles (https://www.space.com/15830-light-speed.html)

	In one second = <7.5> times around the Earth!

From our World of Processors
############################

Manufacturing Process = <14>nm (https://ark.intel.com/products/97128/Intel-Core-i7-7700-Processor-8M-Cache-up-to-4_20-GHz)

Transistor Count = <1,400,000,000> transistors (https://www.anandtech.com/show/7003/the-haswell-review-intel-core-i74770k-i54560k-tested/5)

Die Size: <264>mm^2

Number of cores = <4>

Number of threads = <8>

Maximum (turbo) clock frequency = <4.20> GHz.

Maximum memory = <64> GB.

Distance between transistors = <434.248> nanometers (work shown below)

	sqrt(1.4*10^9) = 37416.57387 transistors per side

	lengh of a = sqrt(264)

	a = 16.24808 mm

	Distance between each transistors = lengh/transistors

	d = 16.24808/37416.57387

	d = 4.34248*10^-4 mm

Time to move electrons between adjacent transitors = <1.9738545> picoseconds

	time = distance/speed

	speed of electron = 220,000 meters/ps

	distance = 4.34248e-7 meters

	time = 1.9738545e-12 seconds

Counting up
###########

Time until the register hit the maximum value = <261.64534> Years

	2.7GHz = 2700000000 Cycles Per Second (cps) (http://www.kylesconverter.com/frequency/gigahertz-to-cycles-per-second)

	64bit/cps = time in seconds

	(2^64-1)/2700000000 = 6832127435 seconds

	seconds/60 = minutes/60 = hours/24 = days/365 = years
